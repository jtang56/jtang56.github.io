                I wear my Fossil watch every single day. Wearing it everyday causes wear and tear, which can be seen throughout the bezel of the watch and the shape of the strap. I've found a watch to be extremely useful throughout the day to the point where it annoys me when I forget to put one on.<br><br>
                This is the new Motorola Moto 360 2nd Generation Smartwatch! It's a lot cheaper than the Apple Watch, and the reviews are all pretty good as well. The battery life lasts throughout the whole day, and it comes with its own wireless charging base where it can dock every night. I've been looking into expanding my watch collection, because sometimes I want to change it up a bit. So this watch has a black bezel, with a black frame and black strap, a contrast from my silver bezel and brown strap Fossil watch that I received over 2 years ago!
