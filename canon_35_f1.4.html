                This lens is probably the one lens I want most and would use the most too. At $1099.99, this is a bargain! During the summer, it came with a hefty price
                of $1500, but now that the second (newer) version came out, this had a price drop. I think this would make me very happy! <br><br>
                35mm lenses are the ultimate lenses, because they allow a photographer to be extremely creative with 
                their shots. This is a prime lens, which means it has no zoom functionality. It has one focal length, and one focal length only. 35mm! 
                This forces me to really look for my shots, and frame it efficiently based on where I actually stand. If you notice in the title, this 
                lens also has an "f/1.4" aperture, which means it allows A LOT of light into the lens. It would be great for low light photography, 
                as well as very beautiful depth of field. Depth of field basically means keeping the foreground image sharp, while blurring out 
                the whole background.
                <br><br>
                
                These are examples of "depth of field" using a lens with f/4, so you can know how much better an f/1.4 is!<br><br><br>
