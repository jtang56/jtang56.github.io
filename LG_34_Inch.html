A monitor?? Why, you ask? As a Computer Science student, I spend most of my day looking at a screen anyways. A second monitor would greatly improve my efficiency and productivity by allowing me to have a second screen. <br><br>
                At Costco, everybody (except the interns) have dual monitor setups. This is because dual monitors are proven to increase productivity of the user. For me, I would be able to rotate the extra wide monitor on its side, allowing me to read hundreds of lines of code at a time. I would not have to constantly scroll up and down to find specific things in my programs. <br><br>
                Help me make my life easier! It's pretty expensive, but you can get it for me if you feel that it would help me more than the other lenses.
